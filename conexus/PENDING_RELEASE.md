# Pending release: plugin changes that are NOT live yet

`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` pins `plugins[].source.ref` to an immutable
release tag. Claude Code loads this plugin's hooks, commands, skills, and agents
from **that tag**, not from your working tree. So every change below is merged
on `develop` and **inert in every running session** until the next release ships
and users install it.

This file is the acknowledgement ledger for that gap. It exists because the gap
is otherwise invisible: on 2026-07-25 a subagent ran `git stash -u` in a shared
tree and the guard that covers exactly that verb did not fire, because the
coverage had landed hours earlier and the installed plugin was still `v6.18.1`.
Three guards had been merged, closed as "mechanized", and were protecting
nothing.

**Rules, enforced by `tests/test_plugin_release_drift_ledger.py`:**

- Every file under the behavioural surface that differs from the pinned tag MUST
  be listed here. Adding a guard without declaring it fails the suite.
- When a release ships and the pin advances, drift goes to zero and this list
  MUST be emptied. A stale entry also fails the suite, so the ledger cannot
  quietly become fiction.
- Do NOT "fix" a failure by deleting entries. The entry is the honest statement
  that the thing is not yet live.

**Do not use this to justify skipping a release.** If a guard matters enough to
mechanize, it matters enough to ship.

**Deferring a straddling entry (nexus-2x3qy).** A plugin cut (`scripts/
cut_plugin_release.py`) refuses when a ledger entry's bead also touches wheel
content (`src/`, `conexus/plans/`, `conexus/daemon/`, `mcpb/`, `dt/`) the
wholesale import cannot hold back on a per-entry basis. The only fix is moving
that entry under `## Deferred to the next client release` below: the cut then
holds the entry's channel path(s) back from itself too (restored to the base
branch's own content) so the whole bead ships together, in one piece, at the
next client release. A deferred entry is exempt from the release-window
"ledger must be empty" rule above -- still declared there is correct, not
stale -- and stays exactly where it is until moved back deliberately.

## Awaiting the next release or plugin cut (pinned: v7.59.0)

_Empty. Everything listed here (nexus-rcoze: the nx-hook shim, the rerouted
entries and the veh77 wiring) went live with 7.59.0 when `source.ref` advanced
to `v7.59.0`._

## Deferred to the next client release

_Empty. The four RDR-215 straddling beads deferred here by nexus-2x3qy
(nexus-t9klx, nexus-z9cz2, nexus-silj0, nexus-veh77) shipped with the 7.58.0
client release, except their hooks.json entries: 7.58.0 kept the v7.57.0
plugin-script entries, because an older `nx-hook` exits 2 on a verb it does not
know. Moving those entries to `nx-hook` verbs is future plugin-surface drift
and gets declared here when it lands; version lockstep never moves._
