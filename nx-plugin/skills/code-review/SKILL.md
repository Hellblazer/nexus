# Code Review Skill

Delegates to the **code-review-expert** agent (model: sonnet).

## When This Skill Activates

- After writing or modifying significant code (10+ lines)
- When completing a feature or bug fix
- After refactoring existing code
- Before creating a pull request
- When code quality, security, or best practices review is needed

## Agent Invocation

## Relay Template (Use This Format)

When invoking this agent via Task tool, use this exact structure:

```markdown
## Relay: {agent-name}

**Task**: [1-2 sentence summary of what needs to be done]
**Bead**: [ID] (status: [status]) or 'none'

### Input Artifacts
- nx store: [document titles or "none"]
- nx memory: [project/title path or "none"]
- Files: [key files or "none"]

### Deliverable
[What the receiving agent should produce]

### Quality Criteria
- [ ] [Criterion 1]
- [ ] [Criterion 2]
- [ ] [Criterion 3]
```

**Required**: All fields must be present. Agent will validate relay before starting.

For additional optional fields, see [RELAY_TEMPLATE.md](../../agents/_shared/RELAY_TEMPLATE.md).

## Review Methodology

The code-review-expert agent uses hypothesis-driven review:
1. Form hypothesis about code quality patterns
2. Gather evidence from code structure, naming, patterns
3. Validate against best practices and security requirements
4. Document findings with file:line references

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All changed files analyzed
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities flagged
- [ ] Best practices validated
- [ ] Specific remediation guidance provided
- [ ] At least one positive feedback item included
