<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
If you think there is even a 1% chance a skill might apply to what you are doing, you MUST invoke the skill.

IF A SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT.

This is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.

# Using nx Skills

## The Rule

**Invoke relevant skills BEFORE any response or action.** Even a 1% chance a skill might apply means you should invoke the skill to check. If an invoked skill turns out to be wrong for the situation, you do not need to use it.

## Routing: What Skill Do I Use?

**Before writing any code:**
- About to implement? → `/nx:brainstorming-gate` FIRST (mandatory, no exceptions)
- Multi-step work? → `/nx:create-plan` before touching code
- Feature needs design (APIs, data models, component boundaries, integration)? → `/nx:architecture`

**Something is broken:**
- Test failure, exception, unexpected behavior → `/nx:debug` IMMEDIATELY (do not guess-and-retry)
- After 2 failed fix attempts without `/nx:debug` → you are wasting time, invoke it NOW

**Analyzing code:**
- Need to understand structure, patterns, dependencies → `/nx:analyze-code`
- Need to investigate WHY something behaves a certain way → `/nx:deep-analysis`
- Rule: if `analyze-code` didn't answer the question, escalate to `deep-analysis`

**Executing work:**
- Plan approved, ready to build? → `/nx:implement`
- Beads need enrichment after audit? → `/nx:enrich-plan`

**Quality gates:**
- Code changes ready? → `/nx:review-code`
- Plan exists? → `/nx:plan-audit` (validates against codebase reality)
- Want logic/structure critique? → `/nx:substantive-critique` (reasoning soundness)
- Tests written? → `/nx:test-validate`

**Research and knowledge:**
- Unfamiliar topic or technology comparison → `/nx:research`
- 3+ validated findings worth keeping → `/nx:knowledge-tidy`
- PDF to index → `/nx:pdf-process`

**RDR lifecycle:** `/nx:rdr-create` → `/nx:rdr-research` → `/nx:rdr-gate` → `/nx:rdr-accept` → `/nx:rdr-close`
- List: `/nx:rdr-list` | Show: `/nx:rdr-show NNN`

**Reference skills (invoke when relevant, no agent dispatch):**
- Symbol navigation (definitions, callers, renames) → `/nx:serena-code-nav`
- nx CLI usage → `/nx:nexus`
- Interactive CLI/REPL control → `/nx:cli-controller`
- Creating/editing nx skills → `/nx:writing-nx-skills`

## Essential MCP Tools

**Use these directly — they are always available, no skill invocation needed.**

**Sequential Thinking** (`mcp__plugin_nx_sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking`):
Use for any non-trivial decision: debugging hypotheses, design choices, plan evaluation, risk assessment. State hypothesis → gather evidence → evaluate → branch or proceed. Set `needsMoreThoughts: true` to continue, `isRevision: true` to correct.

**nx Storage Tiers** (read widest → narrowest before any work):
- **T3** `nx search`: Permanent knowledge across all sessions and projects — check before researching
- **T2** `nx memory`: Project decisions, findings, session context — check before project work
- **T1** `nx scratch`: This session's discoveries, shared across all agents — check before duplicating sibling work

## Skill Priority

When multiple skills could apply:

1. **Discipline first** (brainstorming-gate) — determines HOW to approach
2. **Process second** (strategic-planning, plan-validation, code-review) — guides workflow
3. **Implementation third** (development, debugging, architecture) — executes work

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Correct Action |
|---------|---------------|
| Test fails → try a different fix | Test fails → `/nx:debug` |
| "Simple" feature → start coding | Any feature → `brainstorming-gate` first |
| Complex feature → `/nx:create-plan` | Complex feature → `/nx:architecture` THEN `/nx:create-plan` |
| Plan looks good → start implementing | Plan exists → `/nx:plan-audit` first |
| grep for symbol callers | Symbol navigation → `/nx:serena-code-nav` |
| Read whole file to find a method | Symbol lookup → `/nx:serena-code-nav` |
| Skip review, it's a small change | Any change → `/nx:review-code` before commit |

## Skill Types

**Rigid** (brainstorming-gate): Follow exactly. Do not adapt away discipline.

**Flexible** (patterns, reference): Adapt principles to context.

The skill itself tells you which type it is.

## User Instructions

Instructions say WHAT, not HOW. "Add X" or "Fix Y" does not mean skip workflows. Always check skills first.
