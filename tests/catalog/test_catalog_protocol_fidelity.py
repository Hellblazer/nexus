"""RDR-168 P2.1 (bead nexus-ja47l): guards for the caller-facing catalog Protocol pair.

`nexus.catalog.catalog_protocol` declares the `CatalogReader` / `CatalogWriter` subset
that `test_catalog_conformance.py` enumerates. These tests guard two things that, if
wrong, would silently weaken the conformance test:

1. FIDELITY — each Protocol method's (name, kind) parameter list matches the canonical
   `Catalog` exactly, so the Protocol can never drift from the local source of truth.
2. SCOPE HONESTY — the subset hides none of the 19 audited divergences and excludes only
   genuine internal helpers; the writer surface is exactly the tooling-enforced
   `CATALOG_WRITE_OPS`. (This is the silent-scope-reduction guard the RDR gate flagged:
   a Protocol that quietly omitted a breaking method would make the conformance test pass
   for the wrong reason.)
